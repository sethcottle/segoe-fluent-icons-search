# üôã FAQs
‚ñ∫ **Can I use this with macOS?**

Yes! You just need to [download Microsoft's Segoe Fluent Icons font](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/downloads/#fonts) and install it. If you're on Windows 10, you'll also [need to download the font](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/downloads/#fonts).

‚ñ∫ **I installed the font, but I'm still seeing "‚ñ°" instead of glyphs.**

You'll need to restart Figma and relaunch the plugin due to font caching.

‚ñ∫ **Can I download the SVGs of these icons?**

No, not through Segoe Fluent Icons Search‚Äîthis plugin only allows you to preview and copy individual glyphs.

‚ñ∫ **A few of the glyphs are still showing as empty boxes (‚ñ°).**

A few glyphs are only available on Windows 11, and not included directly in the Segoe Fluent Icon font.
